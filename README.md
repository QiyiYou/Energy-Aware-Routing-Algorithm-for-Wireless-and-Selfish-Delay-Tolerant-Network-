# Energy-Aware-Routing-Algorithm-for-Wireless-and-Selfish-Delay-Tolerant-Network-
Routing Algorithm for selfish Delay Tolerant Network where Selfishness of node is proportional to battery available in the node

It has 2 Factors 
Alpha :- Which Increases when the distance between the node (Senedr and Reciever) Increases
Beta :- Which Decreases when Battery Increases

Hence to find the next best to which data need to be send is find by minimizing the sum of Alpha and Beta

and it plots the graph with Flooding and other Basic Algorithm

Distribution of all nodes i the algorithm are considered to be random
